   ^
temp.c:6:3: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
temp.c:8:7: error: ‘i’ undeclared (first use in this function)
   for(i=0;i<size;i++)
       ^
temp.c:11:11: error: ‘j’ undeclared (first use in this function)
       for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
           ^
temp.c:17:4: error: ‘starcount’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    starcount++;
    ^
temp.c:26:1: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]
